The content of this talk is motivated from the two classes, I am taking this semester at Columbia Data Science Institute.

- [COMS W4995 Applied Machine Learning ](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s19/schedule/) *taught by* Andread C. MÃ¼ller, core contributer of sci-kit learn and author of the O'Reilly book "Introduction to machine learning with Python", describing a practical approach to machine learning with python and scikit-learn. 
- [COMS W4721 Machine Learning for Data Science](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/W4721/Spring2019/W4721Spring2019.html) * taught by*
Prof. John Paisley. He also teaches a course on [**Machine Learning**](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-columbiax-csmm-102x-0) through **edx**.The content of his on-campus course largely overlaps with his edx class.
